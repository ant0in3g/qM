\title{Quantum Mechanics }

\prof{Antoine Géré}

\maketitle

This is not a course on quantum mechanics. I just give here few interesting links for those of you who are keen to know and study a bit about this topic. I hope the students who asked me about it will find what they are looking for. As usual feel free to ask questions, by mail or in person.\par

\medskip

Everything will be english just to show you that you have plenty of work before spending your whole time studying this subject.

\begin{itemize}
  \item[$\bullet$] a \href{https://youtu.be/Rs572Cf4zkk}{video} made by a student doing her PhD in quantum computing. She gives plenty of free resources and tips to start your journey in the quantum world.
  \item[$\bullet$] blog of \href{https://webspace.science.uu.nl/~gadda001/goodtheorist/qmech.html}{Gerard't Hooft}, nobel prize on Physics. He gives good ressources
